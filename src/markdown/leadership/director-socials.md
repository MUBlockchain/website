name: Allie Blackburn
title: Director of Social Media
description: My curiosity allows me to develop skills quickly in new environments which has allowed me to grow in accounting as well as the areas of my two minors. Over my past year and a half in college I have exponentially improved my communication skills which are a huge factor in any business situation. This recent improvement has prepared me for my current involvement in a student run business consulting firm and being the recruitment chair for the largest business organization on campus, Women In Business. I am now ready to use all of the business experience I have learned in my courses and my previously listed campus involvement to a real world setting, where my curiosity will drive me to contribute to the best of my abilities.
