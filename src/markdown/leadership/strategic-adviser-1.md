title: Strategic Adviser
description: People, the environment, and technology absolutely fascinate me. They are where my passions lie; through being a lover of sales, marketing, consulting, leadership, and economics, actively getting experience with developing blockchain solutions, and being an environmentalist through a love of sustainability. Professionally, I am the Co-Founder and CEO of blOX Consulting, a Blockchain Consulting and Development company bringing valuable Blockchain Solutions to multiple clients. Besides Consultation, we provide introductory Blockchain Presentations and Webinars, Blockchain Development work with Solidity and Hyperledger, software security audits, testing and feedback, compliance expertise, marketing, and more. I plan to graduate in 2020 from Miami University of Ohio with a B.S. in Business Economics and a minor in Data Analytics. I have also enjoyed taking classes in science and entrepreneurship. After college, I am looking to work in Blockchain consulting and run my own business, but I am interested in hearing about any internship or job opportunity that comes my way and am very flexible. Thank you so much for visiting.
