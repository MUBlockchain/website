  *MU Blockchain Club is incredibly excited to be hosting the 2020 Blockchain
  Accounting Summit on October 29th from 5pm to 8pm virtually. The financial
  information industry is poised for a massive fintech transformation, and we
  have brought some of the industry heads to speak on how they are leading the
  charge.*




  *First, MUBC, Dr. Brian Ballou of the Accounting department, and EY Senior Assurance Manager Kyle Kauffman will give participants an introduction to the intersection of blockchain and accounting (~5pm-6pm). All context, technical jargon, and foundational concepts required to understand the space will be demystified.*




  *Next begins the headline panel: Blockchain in the Accountant's Emerging Technology Toolbox. This panel brings industry leaders to speak on when, where, and how they are considering blockchain solutions in their day to day lives. Participants include EY's Global Blockchain Lead Chen Zur and PwC Finance Operations and Strategy Director Noam Heller, with moderation by Michael Hiles, CEO of Cincinnati FinTech & Compliance Solutions firm 10XTS.*




  *Finally, EY will demonstrate their suite of baseline proof of concepts and tools at [ey.blockchain.com](http://ey.blockchain.com/). Participants of all skill levels will be given the chance to follow along and explore EY's forensic blockchain analyzer and OpsChain enterprise resource planner dashboard. As a leader in the construction of commercial distributed ledger technology, EY is paving the way for adoption of shared business ledgers with their open-source edi/ value added network solution, and this workshop is the place for anyone curious on its commercial implications to judge for themselves the impact of this technology.*




  *We at MUBC know that blockchain presents a clear and present value to our current business ecosystem. COVID-19 demonstrated how fragile our highly globalized economy can be in a frenzy. With the Blockchain Accounting Summit, we aim to demonstrate to our faculty the opportunity to be among the first universities moving to meet demand for blockchain-skilled forensic auditors and compliance managers. Join us on October 29th starting at 500pm ET at [https://mubc.io/events/​blockchain-accounting-summit](https://mubc.io/events/blockchain-accounting-summit)​to participate!*
